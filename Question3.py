# Q3. What is the partitioning of variance in ANOVA, and why is it important to understand this concept?\

# Answer - 

# The partitioning of variance in Anova is the total variation within the groups and between the groups

# If the variation between group means is significantly larger than the variation 
 # within groups, it suggests a significant difference between the means of the groups
