# Q7. In a repeated measures ANOVA, how would you handle missing data, and what are the potential
# consequences of using different methods to handle missing data?

# Answer - 

# 1. Complete Case Analysis (Listwise Deletion):
#         Method: Remove cases with missing data from the analysis.

# 2. Pairwise Deletion (Available Case Analysis):
        # Method: Analyze each variable separately for available cases. Different variables may have different sample sizes.

# 3. Imputation Methods:
        # Methods: Impute missing values with estimated values. Common methods include mean imputation, median imputation, regression imputation, and more advanced techniques like multiple imputation.

# 4. Mixed Effects Models (LMM or GEE):
        # Method: Use mixed effects models (e.g., Linear Mixed Models - LMM or Generalized Estimating Equations - GEE) to account for missing data under the missing at random (MAR) assumption.
